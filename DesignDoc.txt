Debugging GAS
https://github.com/tranek/GASDocumentation#debugging-sd
In Config/DefaultGame.ini you must do the following
[/Script/GameplayAbilities.AbilitySystemGlobals]
bUseDebugTargetFromHud=true

showdebug abilitysystem
AbilitySystem.Debug.NextCategory
AbilitySystem.Debug.NextTarget

Alternativevly EnableGDT and then GAS is bound to numpad 3

PRIMARY - default to 10.  10 is "average".
Str (physical damage and carry capacity)
Agi (speed and Defense and Critical)
Sta (fortitude and fatigue bar)
Vigor (health)
Metal (number metal arcana spells, spell modifiers)
Will (resolve, metal divinity spells)


SECONDARY
Armor Penetration - % of armor ignored - based on items or abilities - defaults to 0
Block - % of physical damage you can ignore extra, based on items or abilities - default 0.  STEPHEN uses this as the raw % to block and you block 50% if yes.  Value = 0-100
CarryCapacity - based on strength - weight of shit you can carry - Str x 10

Critical - percentage a hit will do crit damage - based on Agi
This means Ag 10 = 10% of doing a crit.

CriticalDamage - bonus damage a crit does.  Default to 2x (2.f).  Weapons should have bonuses to this that are percentages.  A crit dagger may add a further 20% for example.  This may need a curve table so that the 2x can go up after a while.  Certain classes may go up faster.

DamageModifier - added melee damage in addition to weapon (based on str - 10)

Defense (reduces physical damage, based on Agility and Armor worn (which may negate agi) - so this is a culmination of Armor worn + natural defenses.  (armor will boost this)
So if my Ag is 10, I have a Damage reduction of 10%.  If I'm wearing leather armor that adds 5 defense, I'd have a 15% Defense.

Fortitude - armor against poisons, diseases, etc - based on sta - 10 -> this should be renamed to Resistance_PoisonDisease


HealthRegen - default to 0 - health gain per second - based on items or abilities
MetalManaRegn - default to 0 - mana gain per second - based on items or abilities
Resolve - armor against mental attacks based on Wil - 10
Speed - how fast you move - based on Agi - right now just make it agi

VITAL - going to start these at 20 - not hooked up properly currently just hardcoded 20
This will be based off of custom calculation
Health and Max Health (80 + (2.5*Vigor) + (10 * Level)) = 115 to start
MetalMana and Max Metal Mana (50 + (2.5*Metal) + (10 * Level))
Fatigue and Max Fatigue (based on stamina * 2.5 + 10)

RESISTANCES
Fire (based off of Dex?)
Lightning (based off of Dex?)
Arcane - modified by Wil
Physical - this is Defense.  But Defense always applies (this is where if you want to ignore armor you have to pump the armor pen up).  Some things like a poison gas we want to have an IgnoreArmor tag or something that means you can't block or use Defense at all.

Fortitude - this is vs Poison and Disease and needs renamed to be a Resistance - based on Stamina.

DAMAGE
Sword will do 5 damage out of the gate
Short Sword will do 3 damage out of the gate
Dagger will do 2 damage out of the gate

Level 0 mook guy take him down in 4 swings with sword means thats 20 damage but Defense 2 means he's ignoring 8 damage but takes 12 - give him 10 health


CHARACTER CLASSES
These are the base classes that can be given different names to enemies however you need to as well as to the characters however you need to.  The character translation will be given.

Every level - you can gain max +2 points to attributes

Warrior = Drummer - melee attacks and tanking.  High defense.  
(1) S16 A10 V14 St12 M8 Wil10
(5) S20 A12 V16 St14 M8 Wil10
  
Ranger - Rhythm Guitar - ranged combat physical based (guns, bows)
(1) S10 A16 V10 St8 M14 Wil12
(5) S12 A20 V10 St8 M16 Wil14

Metalimancy - Lead Guitar - wizard (powers are mostly metal with some will)
(1) S8 A10 V10 St12 M16 Wil14
(5) S8 A10 V12 St14 M20 Wil16

Metalilyte - Bass - healer and buffs with good defenses and ok melee - cleric (mix of powers with metal and will)
(1) S10 A8 V14 St10 M12 Wil16
(5) S12 A8 V16 St10 M14 Wil20

Controller (bard / spread caster) - Vocalist - powerful buffs and debuffs of the enemy, low defenses, ok melee, low damage spread to many opponents (powers are mostly metal with some will) but can use physical attacks too (hence the agility)
(1) S8 A14 V12 St10 M16 Wil10
(5) S8 A16 V14 St10 M20 Wil12

Skirmisher - synth - crits, sneaking, hiding, scouting, positioning.  low to medium defenses and strong melee attacks or sneaking ranged attacks - thief / assassin
(1) S12 A16 V10 St14 M8 Wil10
(5) S14 A20 V12 St16 M8 Wil10

SECONDARY CLASS
Minions - 1 hit wonders
Standard
Elite - mini boss
Boss

Ability Damage
lets say that level 1 does d8 which average = 5
1 = 5; 5 = 10; 15 = 30; 20 = 45; 40 = 125



THINGS TO DO
* Blocking is implemented and tested and works.  There is a bool on CharacterBase that says if its blocking.  However nothing currently sets that on.  The enemy will need to be able to block.  Humans will be able to block by hitting a block button.

* Blocking should incur a fatigue loss.  This should be a value in line with stamina.  Maybe add a secondary attribute called Blocking Fatigue.  This may be a percentage of the overall fatigue hit you ignore.  So higher the stamina or whatever the more you ignore.  Perhaps the fatigue == the raw damage you take.  So this would be like a form of Defense only strictly for the stamina side of things.

* Resistances need implemented.  Things like Fortitude are vs Poison so that should come out and belong to Resistances.

* Weapons themselves need to bolster armor pen.  Strength helps but if i'm whipping around a wand of fireballs, I shouldn't be adding my strength armor penetration to it.  Therefore that would make my penetration 0 unless IT had that tag.

* Defense is currently based off of pure Agility score.  So your agility score is your defense which m eans you will physically negate Agility%.  Heavier armor should cap that you shouldn't get full agility with heavy armor (and it should make you slower but absorb more).

* Ragdoll should get a force so he just doesn't accordian on himself.

* Shield / Blocking implement resistances need added to the Block method in ExecCalc_Damage.  A shield's resistance to fire shouldn't always apply unless using it.


ASSETS NEEDED
Synty's Shop $200 package has guitars and microphones.  These obviously match the style and don't look out of place.

UE asset store search for Guitar Props but these are not low poly
