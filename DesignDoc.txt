PRIMARY - default to 10.  10 is "average".
Str (physical damage and carry capacity)
Agi (speed and Defense and Critical)
Sta (fortitude and fatigue bar)
Vigor (health)
Metal (number metal arcana spells, spell modifiers)
Will (resolve, metal divinity spells)


SECONDARY
Armor Penetration - % of armor ignored - based on items or abilities - defaults to 0
Block - % of physical damage you can ignore extra, based on items or abilities - default 0
CarryCapacity - based on strength - weight of shit you can carry - Str x 10
Critical - percentage a hit will do crit damage - based on Agi (try Agi - 10 = %)
CriticalDamage - bonus damage a crit does (Agi - 10 for now)
DamageModifier - added melee damage in addition to weapon (based on str - 10)
Defense (reduces physical damage, based on Agility - 10 and Armor worn (which may negate agi) - so this is a culmination of Armor worn + natural defenses.  (armor will boost this)
Fortitude - armor against poisons, diseases, etc - based on sta - 10
HealthRegen - default to 0 - health gain per second - based on items or abilities
MetalManaRegn - default to 0 - mana gain per second - based on items or abilities
Resolve - armor against mental attacks based on Wil - 10
Speed - how fast you move - based on Agi - right now just make it agi

VITAL - going to start these at 20 - not hooked up properly currently just hardcoded 20
This will be based off of custom calculation
Health and Max Health (80 + (2.5*Vigor) + (10 * Level)) = 115 to start
MetalMana and Max Metal Mana (50 + (2.5*Metal) + (10 * Level))
Fatigue and Max Fatigue (based on stamina * 2.5 + 10)

DAMAGE
Sword will do 5 damage out of the gate
Short Sword will do 3 damage out of the gate
Dagger will do 2 damage out of the gate

Level 0 mook guy take him down in 4 swings with sword means thats 20 damage but Defense 2 means he's ignoring 8 damage but takes 12 - give him 10 health
